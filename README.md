# Day 2 - React Learning Journey

## Overview

This project represents my second day of learning React. It’s still a bit complicated, but I’m starting to see the potential it holds. I’m also integrating TypeScript into the process, which feels like a good match for my solid foundation in JavaScript.

The project is a basic shopping list app built in React. While it took most of my day, it was a valuable learning experience, and I’ve gained a lot of insight into how React works.

## What I Learned

### 1. **useState**
One of the first things I explored was React's `useState` hook. It’s great to have a standard way of managing state in a component. This made managing and updating state much easier than I expected.

### 2. **State Passing Between Components**
I ran into an interesting challenge when trying to pass state between components. Passing state down to child components using props was straightforward, but passing state up to the parent component proved more difficult. From what I understand, the solution to this is to pass a callback function to the child component and handle state management at the parent level.

### 3. **Redux**
I’ve heard a lot about Redux for state management, but I decided not to dive into it just yet. However, I can see how having a central state management system for the entire application, accessible from anywhere, would be extremely helpful in larger projects.

## Conclusion

Building this basic shopping list app was a great hands-on way to reinforce what I’ve learned. React and TypeScript are starting to feel more intuitive, and I’m excited to keep building on this foundation. Looking forward to tackling new challenges and improving my skills with each project.
